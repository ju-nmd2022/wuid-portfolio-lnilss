        <p>
          This is a digital painting done in Paint Tool SAI of Korean pop
          musician Yang Jungwon, who is one of the members of ENHYPEN. The
          colour palette was inspired by their Dimension:Dilemma album cover
          that features deep orange and green artwork. Although this style is
          somewhat realistic, it is a more stylized version of realism.
