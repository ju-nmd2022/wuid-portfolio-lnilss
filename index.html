              Hi! My name is Linnea and I am a student at Jönköping University.
              I am from Oregon in the United States but moved to Sweden a year
              ago to be closer to my family. Since August, I have been living
              here in Jönköping. I chose the New Media Design course because of
              my love for being creative while also problem solving
              logistically.
            </p>
